# What are queues?

Queues are lists where insertion is done at the end while the deletion is done at the front end. It follows the first in first out order(FIFO).

# Operations on queue

1. Enqueue- Inserts the element at the rear end of the list. 
2. Dequeue- Deletes an element from the beginning of the list.
