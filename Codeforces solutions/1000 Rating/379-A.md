## Code solution :

```cpp

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    //Input
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    // Initially, a candles are already burning, so ans=a
    int ans = a, temp = 0;
    // Loop till candle is greater or equal to went out candle
    while (a >= b){
        // converting went out candles into new and storing it in ans
        ans += (a / b);
        // left candles from went out candles
        temp = a % b;
        // updating 'a' with candles used to make new candles so it can be used in next iteration 
        a = a / b;
        // adding left candles from went out candles also as they can be reused
        a += temp;
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
