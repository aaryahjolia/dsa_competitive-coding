# DFS or Depth first Search 
### In this article, we will discuss the DFS algorithm in the data structure. It is a recursive algorithm to search all the vertices of a tree data structure or a graph. The depth-first search (DFS) algorithm starts with the initial node of graph G and goes deeper until we find the goal node or the node with no children

## Applications of DFS algorithm
1. DFS algorithm can be used to implement the topological sorting.
2. It can be used to find the paths between two vertices.
3. It can also be used to detect cycles in the graph.
4. DFS algorithm is also used for one solution puzzles.
5. DFS is used to determine if a graph is bipartite or not.

## C++ Code
```c
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Graph class represents a directed graph
// using adjacency list representation
class Graph {
public:
	map<int, bool> visited;
	map<int, list<int> > adj;

	// function to add an edge to graph
	void addEdge(int v, int w);

	// DFS traversal of the vertices
	// reachable from v
	void DFS(int v);
};

void Graph::addEdge(int v, int w)
{
	adj[v].push_back(w); // Add w to vâ€™s list.
}

void Graph::DFS(int v)
{
	// Mark the current node as visited and
	// print it
	visited[v] = true;
	cout << v << " ";

	// Recur for all the vertices adjacent
	// to this vertex
	list<int>::iterator i;
	for (i = adj[v].begin(); i != adj[v].end(); ++i)
		if (!visited[*i])
			DFS(*i);
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	// Create a graph given in the above diagram
	Graph g;
	g.addEdge(0, 1);
	g.addEdge(0, 2);
	g.addEdge(1, 2);
	g.addEdge(2, 0);
	g.addEdge(2, 3);
	g.addEdge(3, 3);

	cout << "Following is Depth First Traversal"
			" (starting from vertex 2) \n";
	g.DFS(2);

	return 0;
}```
